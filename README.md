This R script first reads the text files containing human activity recognition using smartphones datasets into data frames. It then merges the two data frames "train" and "test" into one data frame called "train_test". The third part of the code extracts variables of mean and standard deviation by using grep function and subsetting the data frame "train_test". The fourth part of the code creates vector "activity" and "volunteer" containing name of the activity performed in each record and number of the volunteer (subject) who performed the experiment separately. It then adds these two vectors to data frame "train_test" by using the cbind function. The following code assigns descriptive name from file "feature.txt" to each column name of data frame "train_test". In the last part of the code, it converts data frame "train_test" to tbl_df "avg_train_test" in order to perform data manipulation using "dplyr" package. By using group_by and summarize function, "avg_train_test" computes all average measurement values for each activity and each volunteer. Finally, it creates a text file called "avg_upload" containing the results from "avg_train_test".
